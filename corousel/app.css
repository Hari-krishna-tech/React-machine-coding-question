/*
1. Resizing and Responsiveness:
max-width: 100%: This ensures the image never overflows its container, scaling down to fit but not upscaling. 
height: auto: Maintains the image's original aspect ratio when scaling down. 
object-fit: Controls how an image fits within its container, while maintaining aspect ratio. 
cover: Fills the container, clipping the image if necessary. 
contain: Fits the image within the container, potentially leaving space. 
fill: Stretches or squishes the image to fill the container. 
none: The image is not resized. 


2. Image Scaling Quality:
image-rendering: Specifies the algorithm used for image scaling.
auto: (Default) Let the browser choose the algorithm.
pixelated: Preserves pixel appearance for a pixelated look.
crisp-edges: (Non-standard) Similar to pixelated, but with better results on some browsers.
smooth: Smooths out the image during scaling.
optimize-contrast: (Non-standard) Optimizes contrast during scaling.
optimize-speed: (Non-standard) Optimizes speed during scaling.
high-quality: (Non-standard) Prioritizes image quality during scaling.
